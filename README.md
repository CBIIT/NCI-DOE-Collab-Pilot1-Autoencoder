# NCI-DOE-Collab-Pilot1-Gene_Expression_Autoencoder

### Description:
The Feature Reduction capability (P1B1) shows how to build a sparse autoencoder that can compress a high dimensional expression profile into a low-dimensional vector.

### User Community:	
Researchers interested in feature reduction; machine learning; deep learning.


### Usability:	
The provided untrained model can be used by a data scientist to be trained on their own data. The provided scripts use data that have been downloaded and normalized from GDC.

### Uniqueness:	
Many molecular assays generate large numbers of features that can lead to time-consuming processing and over-fitting in learning tasks; hence, a core capability we intend to build is feature reduction.

### Components:	
* Processed training and test data
* Untrained neural network model
* Trained model weights and topology

### Technical Details:
Please refer to this [README](./Pilot1/P1B1/README.md)
